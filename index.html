            <h1>About this program</h1>
            <p>
                Grow with Google and Pluralsight have partnered for the third consecutive year to <br>provide a program
                to support software developers across Africa in three different roles:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Associate Android Developer</li>
                <li>Associate Cloud Engineer</li>
                <li>Mobile Web Specialist</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Google Africa Developer Scholarship program has sponsored 45,000 aspiring developers in Africa to
                skill<br> up with Pluralsight Skills, supported by the Google Developer community. </p>

            <p>This program has multiple phases for you to gain access to excellent Pluralsight Skills courses as<br>
                well as support from the GADS program and the Google Developer Community. All of this is to help you
                upskill on important Google technologies.</p>

            <h2>Keep learning and stay motivated</h2>
            <p>To continue advancing through the sessions to get access to more courses you’ll need to <span
                    class="bold-text">prove you’re dedicated</span> to learning these tech skills. You can do this by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Registering for your selected track. Applicants will be placed in only one track as selected in the
                    onboarding survey during registration.</li>
                <li>Completing all requirements to advance to the next phase</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Advancing to each subsequent phase will help you master in-demand Google developer skills with
                expert-authored Pluralsight content. You'll gain skills that can help you get opportunities after the
                program.</p>
            <p class="tip well"><span class="bold-text">Tip</span>: If you watch a course or take a skill assessment
                during one of the phases, that activity counts toward the current phase <span class="bold-text">as

            <h1>How to get started on Skills</h1>
            <h2>1. Register, then log in to Pluralsight.</h2>
            <p class="note well"><span class="bold-text">Note</span>: You must complete the onboarding survey in order to
                register for this program.</p>

            <p>First, choose your track during the onboarding survey. You will only be registered for the track you
                self-select.</p>

            <p>Once you complete the survey, you will be redirected to a page where you can create a Pluralsight
                account. If you already have a Pluralsight account, use the email on that account to register, so you
                can keep your learning history. Then, to get started on Pluralsight Skills, <span class="bold-text">log
                    in</span> and explore your <span class="bold-text">custom homepage</span>. </p>
            <p class="tip well"><span class="bold-text">Tip</span>: Not sure what your password is? Click here to reset your
                password, and we’ll email you a link to finish resetting your password. Here’s more password reset help
                if you get stuck.</p>
            <p>Throughout the program, you'll receive emails from Andela with updates on the program. You’ll also
                receive email communications from Pluralsight about the platform. </p>

            <h2>2. Once you’re logged into Skills, use channels to guide your learning.</h2>
            <p>You'll find channels on your homepage in Skills. A channel is a grouping of courses centered around a
                specific technology or learning goal. Here's a list of all the channels and what they contain, as well
                as some recommendations on which order to watch content in. We've hand-picked these collections of
                courses to guide your learning. </p>
            <p>You'll also see another channel, <span class="bold-text"> targeted at upgrading your technology
                    career</span> by building your professional business skills.</p>

            <h2>3. Skill up with skill assessments and course tools.</h2>
            <p>What are Pluralsight skill assessments? They’re a simple way to quickly measure a tech skill.</p>
            <p>After taking a skill assessment, you'll get both a numeric score and a level of novice, proficient, or
                expert in a skill area—that’s your Skill IQ. You can even share your Skill IQ on social media, Stack
                Overflow, and LinkedIn.</p>
            <p>After you get your Skill IQ, Pluralsight will give you a personalized skill analysis and recommendations
                on what courses to take to close your skill gaps. </p>
            <p class="tip well"><span class="bold-text">Tip</span>: Use your personalized skill analysis and recommendations
                to help you decide what to watch next. Still not sure? Check out our recommendations below.</p>
            <p>Did you make a mistake, or want to take the assessment again? <span class="bold-text">You get one free
                    Skill IQ do-over, and you can also earn retakes by watching more courses. Here’s how</span>.</p>

            <h1>Course learning tips</h1>
            <p>Each Skills video course details page has tools to help you succeed.</p>
            <img src="./images/video-course-details-page.png" alt="Course detais">

            <p>Begin each course by clicking <span class="bold-text">Start Course</span>. Below that button, you’ll find
                some of these extra learning aids:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A clickable <span class="bold-text">transcript</span> of the course</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="note well"><span class="bold-text">Note</span>: While many Pluralsight courses have transcripts, some do not. We are adding
                transcripts to courses every week.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Exercise</span> files to download. For some courses, this is a .PDF of the
                    course slides; other course exercise files allow you to code along with the author.</li>
                <li>A <span class="bold-text">Discussion </span>board that allows you to post questions and learn along
                    with other learners</li>
                <li>Some courses have <span class="bold-text">learning checks</span> that help gauge what you’ve learned
                    from the course.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On the video player, be sure to notice these features:</p>
            <img src="./images/video-player-features.png" alt="video player features">

            <p><span class="bold-text">A : S</span>kip ahead or backward 10 seconds.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">B : Most courses support closed captioning, or subtitles. If the course has
                    closed captions, you can use our <a
                        href="https://help.pluralsight.com/help/what-is-the-video-player#features">translation</a> tool,
                    also.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">C : </span>Speed up or slow down the course playback.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">D : From the Settings cogwheel, adjust the video playback quality, caption
                    language, and also give us feedback on the course.</p>

            <p>If you're experiencing issues with playing videos, start by checking your connection and identify video
                playback issues using our <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/video/test/">video checkup tool</a>.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, internet bandwidth is not large enough to handle the demand. There are a few reasons why this
                might happen.</p>
            <p>We find that most buffering issues occur when users switch from the <span class="bold-text">Auto</span>
                setting to a higher quality setting. The video player automatically detects bandwidth availability and
                adjusts play quality accordingly to keep a continuous stream. If you manually adjusted it to a higher
                quality setting, change it back to <span class="bold-text">Auto</span>.</p>
            <p>Other reasons include an increased number of people watching Skills video content, the number of devices
                using your WiFi, or your WiFi connection not being strong enough.</p>

            <p>If you are having buffering issues, you can:</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Make sure your WiFi router is centrally located</li>
                <li>Switch the video player setting to Auto</li>
                <li>Download the video using our <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/product/downloads">native apps</a>
                    and <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/downloads">offline player</a>. Once your video is
                    downloaded, you can watch the video without internet connection. Learn more about downloading

                you have access to as well as which skill assessment(s) you should take for your specific track.
                Channels are lists of the courses you have access to, grouped by topic. Skill assessments allow you to
                gauge your skill level, identify gaps, and measure how your skills increase over time. We’ll add more
                courses to these lists for each phase as the program continues.</p>
            <p>When you click on a channel, please click the blue <span class="bold-text">Join</span> button to add the
                channel to your <span class="bold-text">My Channels list</span>. This way, it'll be easier to find your

            <p class="note well"><span class="bold-text">Note</span>: You must join the channels if you watch courses on the
                the Pluralsight Android or iOS mobile app. Otherwise you won't be able to find your channels. After
                joining each channel on the web, you'll see them in the channels section of your mobile app homepage.
            </p>

            <h2>What order should I watch the courses in?</h2>

            <p>For each phase, you have a Foundations channel and a Deep Dive channel for your track. These channels
                have been broken into sections focused on specific parts of each technology in your track.</p>
            <p>There is no required watching order for the courses in order to be eligible to advance to the next phase;
                however, we have created recommendations if you’d like more guidance to your learning. Otherwise, feel
                free to watch the courses in any order.</p>
            <p>We recommend that you watch all the courses in the Foundations channel first in the order they’re listed.
                This will give you a broad and foundational understanding of important key principles in your track.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve finished the courses in the Foundations channel, you should start watching courses in the
                Deep Dive channel based on what interests you from the Foundations channel and where you might have
                skill gaps. If you’re on the web version of Pluralsight Skills, you can see the channel has been broken
                down into sections to help you identify what you might like to watch next.</p>
